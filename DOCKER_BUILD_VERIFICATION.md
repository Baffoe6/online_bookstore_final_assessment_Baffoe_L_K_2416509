Files tracked by git:
```bash
$ git ls-files run_*.py
run_refactored.py         ✅
run_refactored_tests.py   ✅
run_tests.py              ✅
```

Latest commit:
```
0f0ba13 - fix: Add missing run_refactored.py and run_refactored_tests.py for Docker build
```

## Troubleshooting

If Docker build still fails with "file not found":

1. **Check workflow is using latest commit:**
   - Go to Actions tab
   - Verify the failing workflow is building from commit `0f0ba13` or later
   - If it's building from an older commit, re-run the workflow

2. **Re-run the workflow:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/Baffoe6/online_bookstore_final_assessment_Baffoe_L_K_2416509/actions
   - Click on the failed workflow run
   - Click "Re-run all jobs" button

3. **Verify checkout in workflow:**
   - The workflow should use `actions/checkout@v4`
   - It should check out the latest commit on `main` branch

## Expected Docker Build Steps
