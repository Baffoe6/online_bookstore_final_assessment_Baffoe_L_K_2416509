# ✅ Workflow Steps Explanation - Why Some Steps Were Skipped

## 🎉 Good News: Build Successful!

Your workflows ran successfully! Some steps were **intentionally skipped** based on conditional logic. This is **NORMAL and EXPECTED**.

---

## 📊 Skipped Steps Breakdown

### 1. **Deploy Steps (Skipped) ✅ Expected**

#### Deploy to Staging
```yaml
# .github/workflows/6-deploy.yml line 99
if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/develop' || github.event.inputs.environment == 'staging'
```

**Why Skipped:**
- Only runs on `develop` branch OR when manually triggered with "staging" option
- You pushed to `main` branch → Skipped ✅

**To Run:**
- Push to `develop` branch, OR
- Manually trigger workflow and select "staging"

---

#### Deploy to Production
```yaml
# .github/workflows/6-deploy.yml line 128
if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/v') || github.event.inputs.environment == 'production'
```

**Why Skipped:**
- Only runs on version tags (e.g., `v1.0.0`) OR when manually triggered with "production"
- You pushed to `main` without a tag → Skipped ✅

**To Run:**
- Create and push a version tag: `git tag v1.0.0 && git push origin v1.0.0`, OR
- Manually trigger workflow and select "production"

---

#### Rollback Option
```yaml
# .github/workflows/6-deploy.yml line 166
if: failure()
```

**Why Skipped:**
- Only runs if production deployment FAILS
- Your deployment didn't run, so rollback wasn't needed → Skipped ✅

---

### 2. **PR-Specific Steps (Skipped) ✅ Expected**

#### Comment PR with Coverage
```yaml
# .github/workflows/2-coverage.yml
if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
```

**Why Skipped:**
- Only runs on pull requests to comment on PR with coverage results
- You pushed directly to `main` (not a PR) → Skipped ✅

**To Run:**
- Create a pull request

---

#### Performance Benchmark Comment
```yaml
# .github/workflows/3-performance.yml
if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
```

**Why Skipped:**
- Only runs on pull requests to comment benchmark results on PR
- You pushed directly to `main` (not a PR) → Skipped ✅

**To Run:**
- Create a pull request

---

#### Dependency Review (Security)
```yaml
# GitHub automatically runs this on pull requests only
if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
```

**Why Skipped:**
- Security feature that reviews new dependencies in PRs
- You pushed directly to `main` (not a PR) → Skipped ✅

**To Run:**
- Create a pull request

---

## 🎯 How to Trigger Skipped Steps

### Option 1: Create a Pull Request

This will trigger **all PR-specific steps**:

```bash
# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/testing-workflow

# Make a small change (e.g., update README)
echo "# Test PR" >> README.md

# Commit and push
git add README.md
git commit -m "test: Trigger PR workflows"
git push origin feature/testing-workflow

# Create PR on GitHub
# Go to: https://github.com/Baffoe6/online_bookstore_final_assessment_Baffoe_L_K_2416509/compare
```

**This will trigger:**
- ✅ Coverage PR comment
- ✅ Performance benchmark PR comment
- ✅ Dependency Review

---

### Option 2: Deploy to Staging (Manual)

```
1. Go to: https://github.com/Baffoe6/online_bookstore_final_assessment_Baffoe_L_K_2416509/actions
2. Click: "6. Deploy" workflow
3. Click: "Run workflow" button
4. Select: "staging" environment
5. Click: "Run workflow"
```

**This will trigger:**
- ✅ Deploy to Staging

---

### Option 3: Deploy to Production (Version Tag)

```bash
# Create a version tag
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

**This will trigger:**
- ✅ Deploy to Staging
- ✅ Deploy to Production (after staging succeeds)
- ✅ Create GitHub Release

---

### Option 4: Deploy to Production (Manual)

```
1. Go to: https://github.com/Baffoe6/online_bookstore_final_assessment_Baffoe_L_K_2416509/actions
2. Click: "6. Deploy" workflow
3. Click: "Run workflow" button
4. Select: "production" environment
5. Click: "Run workflow"
```

**This will trigger:**
- ✅ Deploy to Production
